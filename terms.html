We, One of a kind, LLC (“MJC”, “Company”, “We”, “Our,” or “Us”), respect your privacy and are letting you know about Our online privacy policies. This Privacy Policy discloses how We collect, protect, use, and share information gathered about you on oneofakind.com and webpages sharing the same domain (the “Site”).

You can review the most current version of the Terms of Service at any time on this page. We reserve the right to update, change or replace any part of these Terms of Service by posting updates and/or changes to our website.

<br>Our store is hosted on Shopify Inc. They provide us with the online e-commerce platform that allows us to sell our products and services to you.
<br><br><span>SECTION 1 - ONLINE STORE TERMS</span><br>
 
<br>By agreeing to these Terms of Service, you represent that you are at least the age of majority in your state or province of residence, or that you are the age of majority in your state or province of residence and you have given us your consent to allow any of your minor dependents to use this site.

<br>You may not use our products for any illegal or unauthorized purpose nor may you, in the use of the Service, violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright laws).

<br>You must not transmit any worms or viruses or any code of a destructive nature.<br>

<br>A breach or violation of any of the Terms will result in an immediate termination of your Services.<br>
 
<br>The importance of security for all personally identifiable information associated with Our users is of utmost concern to us. We take technical, contractual, administrative, and physical security steps to protect all visitors' information. We use secure socket layer (SSL) encryption across Our Site to protect your information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. As such, We cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information.<br>
There are some things that you can do to help protect the security of your information as well. For instance, never give out your password, since this is what is used to access all of your account information. Also, remember to sign out of your account and close your browser window when you finish surfing the web so that other people using the same computer will not have access to your information. You should use caution when using public Wi-Fi, which can make your personal information available to others if not properly secured.<br>
 
<br>How We Use the Personally Identifiable Information that We Collect<br>
 
<br>We use personally identifiable information in a limited number of ways. We use the information to complete transactions. For instance, if you contact Us for help, We will use the information to contact you. If you place an order, We use your information to ship those goods to you. We use information collected to notify you if you've won a game or contest. Information We collect is also used to send you email updates or news, information on products and services, discounts, upcoming events and newsletters about Our brand(s) and other information we think you will find valuable, periodic mailings, and in some instances telephone contact.<br>
 
<br>Who We Share Your Information With<br>
 
<br>Sometimes we share your information with third party marketing partners (“Marketing Partners”) for commercial purposes. And, sometimes we use third-party companies (“Service Providers”) to help Us target advertising or to market or remarket products you were interested in from Our Site, or to facilitate order processing and fulfillment. In those instances, We share your information with them to target advertising, deliver products, assist Us in collecting and managing customer information, fulfill promotions and/orders and/or communicate with you.
These Marketing Partners and Service Providers include:<br>
• UPS, FedEx, USPS, and other trusted couriers and carriers – Customer mailing address and contact information will be provided to outside entities as necessary to fulfill and deliver orders.<br>
• Various advertisers – We use Facebook, Instagram, Google, Amazon, Bing and other advertising providers to provide advertising services for Us and Our Site. See below on how you can opt-out of tracking by these advertisers.<br>
<br>Some of these companies are given access to some or all of the information you provide Us, and some may use cookies or other tracking technologies on Our behalf. <br>
We use targeted advertising services provided by companies such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon. These services are intended to deliver advertisements that you are likely to be interested in, based on your recent browsing. Those services use technical means such as cookies and pixel tags to collect data as described in their privacy notices in order to help provide ads that are more relevant to you. As pertinent to Our Site, they collect data about your browsing activity, such as which pages you visited and when; technical information about your device and browser such as your device's IP address, device type and unique identifier; information about what ads have been served to you and whether you interacted with the ad; and data from third-party advertising partners such as pseudonymous identifiers to help deliver ads to you and recognize you across browsers and devices. The third-party vendors offer ways to opt out of tracking and that information can be found on their respective websites. <br>
<br>On occasion, We offer promotions — such as giveaways — in conjunction with a sponsor. We may share your information with the sponsors if they need it to send you a product or to fulfill the promotion. We may share your information with those sponsors so that they can send you other special promotions. You will know We are going to do this because We will tell you when you sign up for these kinds promotions. In addition, We will occasionally send e-mail promotions to Our users on behalf of third-party sponsors regarding lifestyle-related products or services.<br>
We may also share information for security reasons to prevent, investigate, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of persons, violations of Our Terms of Service, or as otherwise required by law.
